## Day 13 Pre-Lab Notebook Tips and Reminders

- Remember to include Aims for all parts (Parts 3.14–3.15).

## Day 13 Post-Lab Notebook Tips and Reminders

- Record and discuss your results for all three genes identified. If you were unable to identify a gene for some of your mutants, you may use the back-up sample sequences provided above so that you have three genes total to discuss.
    - What is known about each gene identified in terms of its function or properties (e.g., what processes is it involved in, where is it localized, what other proteins does it interact with, etc.)?
    - How might each gene have been isolated in your screen? Try to come up with a specific molecular mechanism.
