## Day 17 Pre-Lab Notebook Tips and Reminders

Remember to include Aims for all parts (Parts 4.7 and 4.8).

## Day 17 Post-Lab Notebook Tips and Reminders

- Be sure to label the gel photo such that it’s clear what is loaded in each lane and what the sizes of all ladder bands are.
- You should discuss each lane of your gel (lanes/samples with similar overall results can be discussed together as a group if you want).
    - What was the expected overall result for each lane? Why? (Included expected PCR product sizes, if applicable.)
    - What can you conclude based on whether or not you saw the expected result for each lane? Explain your reasoning. If you did not get the expected results, what might be a possible reason to explain the difference?
- Remember to list which plate number you used for setting up your qPCR samples and which well numbers were used for each of your samples.
