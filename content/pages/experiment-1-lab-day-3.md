## Day 3 Pre-Lab Tips and Reminders

What are your Aims for Parts 1.6 and 1.7?

## Day 3 Post-Lab Tips and Reminders

- Record colony counts for all transformation plates. Keep in mind that “zero colonies” is still a valid result!
- Remember to calculate transformation efficiencies for both your YCplac111 plate and your library transformation plates.
    - How do the transformation efficiencies compare between the YCplac111 plasmid and the transposon libraries? What might be a potential reason for any differences?
- You should comment on each transformation plate. (If certain plates have similar overall results or purposes, though, you may comment on those plates together as a group if you want.)
    - What was the expected overall result for each plate and why?
    - What can you conclude from each plate based on whether or not you got the expected results? If you did not get the expected result for certain plates, what might be a potential reason why to explain the difference?
