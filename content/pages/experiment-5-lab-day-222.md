## Day 22 Post-Lab Notebook Tips and Reminders

Follow all instructions and answer all six questions below for your Day 22 post-lab:

1. Record your colony counts for each quadrant on all six plates. Remember that zero colonies is still a result!
2. Calculate how many EBY100 yeast cells and how many L7.5.1 yeast cells were in each of your final bead selections (A, B, and C). For each plate, use the quadrant counts that will likely give you the most accurate data (how will you determine this?). Remember to take into account any serial dilutions.
3. For each of your bead selections A, B, and C, calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Accuracy is a quantitative measure of a selective procedure that takes into account both the sensitivity and specificity of that procedure. (accuracy = final # of true positives + final # of true negatives / total number of starting binders and non-binders)
4. How did each of your selections perform relative to what you were expecting based on the protocol modifications you made? Did your overall observed results match what you were expecting, or did some bead selections perform better or worse than predicted? What are some possible explanations for why?
5. What might you conclude about the particular protocol parameter(s) you modified in terms of how they affect the overall success of the magnetic bead selection procedure?
6. Which of your three bead selections (A, B, or C) do you think performed the best overall? Explain your reasoning.
