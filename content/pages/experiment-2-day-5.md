## Day 5 Pre-Lab Tips and Reminders

What orthogonal assays are you setting up today and what is the purpose of each one? Note that each orthogonal assay has a related but distinct purpose from the other assays.

## Day 5 Post-Lab Tips and Reminders

- Record the results from restreaking your α-factor-resistant mutants onto fresh plates.
- Include both the shmoo assay cell counts and the calculated shmoo formation rates.
- For the shmoo assay, discuss the results for each control sample/strain/condition (similar samples can be discussed together as a group if you want).
    - What was the expected result for each control? Why did you expect that result?
    - What can you conclude from each control based on whether or not you got the expected results? If you did not get the expected result for your controls, what might be a potential reason why to explain the difference?
- For the shmoo assay, discuss the results for each of your six α-factor-resistant mutants. (Similar samples can be discussed together as a group if you want.)
    - What were the results of each mutant strain? How did they compare with your controls, if applicable?
    - What can you conclude about each mutant strain based on the result for each assay? Explain your reasoning.
